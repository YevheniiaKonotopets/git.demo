You held my heart in your hand
While it was still beating
I hope you understand
That this is the way it's meant to be

'Cause we've got nothing to prove
We've got nothing to lose
This is where we belong

So take a look around
It's so magnificent
This love of ours
It's something brilliant
So close your eyes again
And hope the fireworks never end

You held my heart in your hand
While it was still beating
And maybe this true romance
Is getting the better of you and me
